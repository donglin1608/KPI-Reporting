##### Base on the analysis performed in Power BI, the following key insights and trends can be concluded: 
- Total and average sales: The total sales for the business across all regions from January to March amount to approximately $1.04 million, with an average monthly sale of approximately $64.75K per order.

- Sales across regions: When looking at the regional breakdown from the ribbon chart, the East and South regions (Team B) have higher sales when compared to the North and West regions (Team A), indicating better overall performance.

- Number of orders: The total number of distinct orders placed during this period is around 16. This provides an insight into the volume of transactions that were processed.

- Marketing expenditure: The total marketing expenditure during this period amounts to about $126K. In a monthly breakdown, marketing spend has seen a consistent increase which aligns with the objective of driving up sales.

- Sales and marketing expenditure relationship: The waterfall chart indicates a positive correlation between sales and marketing spending. As the marketing expenditure increased, sales also grew. However, the ad campaigns run by Team B were more successful than Team A. An extra $17,000 spent on marketing brought approximately $223K of sales for Team B in July. On the other hand, an extra $20,000 marketing budget brought only $65K in sales for Team A in July.

- Region performance and ranking: The ribbon chart reveals that the East region consistently performed the best in terms of sales. However, even with substantial advertising spend, the West region did not perform proportionally well in sales, indicating potential issues with their advertising campaigns.
